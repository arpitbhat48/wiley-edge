What is collection: Group of objects 

Arrays: Group of objects 
	Employee[] myemps=new Employee[10];

Arrays vs collections: 
	1. Arrays can be of objects as well as primitives vs objects
	2. Array size is fixed vs Dynamic
	3. Array do not have some predefined method. You need to manually process it vs rich library

interface:
Collection
List
Set 
Map


Classes
ArrayList
Vector
LinkedList
HashMap
TreeMap
HashSet
TreeSet
hashtable
PriorityQueue
Deque

Important points to ponder: 

1. List is the only collection, which contains the methods based on index numbers 
2. To add the objects in the Set, your object must override equals and hashcode. If all the objects have the different hashcodes then equals method is not invoked. 
3. If you want object in the TreeSet, your class must implement comparable interface and it should override the method compareTo
5. Customized sorting can be done by implementing Comparator interface, which contains compare method 


What is difference between Dictionary and Map?
how to deal with HashTable? : 
What is difference between HashTable and HashMap?
  HashTable is synchronized and HashMap is Non-Synchronized. So it is more faster. 
  HashTable does not allow null keys or values
  HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values
