Serialization: 
	Storing the object state in the file. 
	    Object must implement Serializable
	       Serializable is marker interface which marks the object eligible for Serialization. Else NotSerializableException
	    FileOutputStream 
	    ObjectOutputStream

Deserialization: 
    Retrieving the object state from file
    	FileInputStream
    	ObjectInputStream 
    	
Steps: Serialization
1. Create a class that implements Serializable
2. Create object of that class
3. Open any file in the write mode, using FileOutputStream 
4. Pass the fileOuputStream to the OBjectOutputStream 
5. Invoke the writeObject() method of ObjectOutputStream, and pass the object that you want to serialize. 


1. Open the file where the objects are serialized in the read mode. 
   using FileInputStream 
2. Pass FileInputStream to OBjectInputStream 
3. Invoke the readObject() method of ObjectInputStream, and cast the 
   object type (e.g. employee) to the object returned.
